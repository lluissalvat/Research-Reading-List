# Research-Reading-List

This is a compilation of research papers employed throughout my academic research internship during the summer of 2022 under the supervision of Dr Robert Gaunt. My main focus is the generalised hyperbolic (GH) distribution, concentrating on both its properties and its applications to the modelling of financial returns.
